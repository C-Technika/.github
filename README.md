We are C-Technika , we create the extraordinary , the things you've never seen before!
Follow us to join an adventure into the unknown , and do not be afraid!
We may put two irrelevant things together just to see what happens, and we may accidentally cause chaos in our projects: 
>Including but not limited to setting the workbench on fire , not having enough components and not finding out until assembly...
Have fun everybody!
